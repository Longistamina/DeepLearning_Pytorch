Traditional programming: Input + Logic rules => Output
(Meaning, we give the computer the inputs, 
and the logic rules based on which to create specific outputs)

ML and DL: Input + Output => the relationship between In-Out, the pattern to apply for future predictions.
(Meaning we give the computer the inputs and the outputs, 
then ask it to find the relationship pattern between In and Out,
then use that pattern for future prediction)

RULE: if you can build a simple rule-based system that does not require ML, DO THAT!!!
(ML and DL are not the solutions for everything!!!)

################################

What is DL good for?

1. Problems with long lists of rules, especially when traditional approach fails
   (For example, the rules for driving a car are so complicated that the traditional approach could not handle)

2. Continually changing environments: DL can adapt (learn) to new scenarios
   (For example, we can be familiar without our town, but to the next town, not.... DL can learn to adapt the new town)

3. Discovering insights withing large collections of data:
   (How to differentiate between 1001 different foods using brute human strength? DL can do)

################################

What is DL not good for?

1. When you need explainability: the patterns learned by a DL could be millions and even billions...

2. When the traditional approach is a better option

3. When errors are unacceptable: outputs of DL model aren't always predictable, they are based on
   probabilistic errors. If your task does not accept that, go back to traditional programming

4. When you don't have much data: DL requires a fairly large amount of data to produce great results

ML vs DL?

ML works well on structured data like tabular data with rows and columns, numeric, string
=> best of ML is XGBoost

DL works well on unstructred data like images, audio, natural languages, ...

DL models are built on neural network architectures.
What is neural network (NN)? Check out 3Blue1brown, StatsQuest

NN anatomy: Input layer (data) -> Hidden layers (learn) -> Output layer (out)

Each layer is composed of a Linear(strait line) and Non-linear (not-straight line) functions

Before training a NN, must encode/embedd the data into numeric types.

Then, NN will learn patterns, features, weights, ....
(patterns, embedding, weights, feature representation, feature vectors -> similar things)

Raw Inputs -> Numerical encoding -> NN learn -> representation outputs -> "human" outputs

###############################

Types of learning:
+ Supervised Learning: Input + Output (labels, supervisors) -> find relationship between In-Out
+ Unsupervised Learning: have Input but no output -> find patterns, cluster data into different groups
+ Transfer Learning: start with a trained model, and train it to do task with new data
+ Reinforcement Learning: give rewards towards wanted action to force model adapt to produce that action more often
